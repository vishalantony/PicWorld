# PicWorld
A small social networking website which helps users share and manage their photos.<br>
<br>
This was my Database Management Systems Lab Project during my 6th semester computer science and <br>
engineering course at U.V.C.E. Bangalore University.<br>
<br>
Technical Details:<br>
To run the platform, set up the database.<br>
How to set up the database:<br>
1> Run the init_everything.php script in the source code directory OR <br>
2> Run the picworld.sql file in the MySQL shell.<br>
<br>
You can now go to the index.php page to register and use the platform.<br>
Please enter the correct details of the mysql configuration on your system in the<br>
files in the include directory.<br>
